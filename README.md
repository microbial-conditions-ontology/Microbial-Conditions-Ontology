# microbial-conditions-ontology

 MCO is a domain ontology that provides a controlled vocabulary for the unambiguous description of microbial growth conditions. The purpose of this ontology is to set an standard for the structured annotation of the experimental conditions in public repositories.
 
 It builds upon extant OBO foundry ontologies and adds 828 terms to describe microbial experimental conditions as a result of Escherichia coli literature curation. It is currently being used in RegulonDB (http://regulondb.ccg.unam.mx/) to relate gene expression data to growth conditions. To this purpose, in parallel, a set of minimal requirements to describe growth conditions was developed based on Neidhardt recommendations for reproducibility [1].
